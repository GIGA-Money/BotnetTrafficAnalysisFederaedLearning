# botnet-traffic-analysis

This is a project for my thesis for IoT botnet traffic analysis *DETECTING, CLASSIFYING AND EXPLAINING IOT BOTNET ATTACKS USING DEEP LEARNING METHODS BASED ON NETWORK DATA*

It additionally attempts to reproduce results from this paper https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.03409

This is the dataset used https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/00442/
